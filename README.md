## Overview

GitClarity is an Edge add-on that provides detailed information about GitHub repositories. With just a single click on a GitHub repository, GitClarity presents users with a comprehensive description of how that repository works. This add-on is built using OpenAI, JavaScript, and HTML, and it operates using the BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model, where users need to enter their OpenAI key to utilize its features.

## Features

- Detailed Repository Description: GitClarity offers users an in-depth understanding of a GitHub repository by providing a comprehensive description of how the repository works. This information can be valuable for developers, researchers, or anyone interested in learning more about a particular repository.

- Seamless Integration: GitClarity seamlessly integrates into your Edge browser, allowing for a smooth and convenient user experience. With a single click on a GitHub repository, you can access its detailed description without leaving the GitHub page.

- OpenAI Integration: GitClarity leverages the power of OpenAI to generate informative and accurate descriptions. The integration with OpenAI ensures high-quality descriptions that help users gain insights into the repository's functionality and purpose.

- BYOK Model: GitClarity operates on the BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model. To use the add-on, users are required to enter their OpenAI key. This ensures the security and privacy of users' data, as the add-on does not store any OpenAI keys or user-specific information.
